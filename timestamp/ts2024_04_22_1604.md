# [title:: Vue Style | Strongly Recommended]

1. Each components should be in their own files.
2. SFC should be PascalCase or kebab-case.
3. Base components[^1] should be having a specific prefix, e.g., `Base`.
4. Child components which tightly coupled with their parents should have the parents name included in their own name:

```js
components/
|- TodoList.vue
|- TodoListItem.vue
|- TodoListItemButton.vue
```

1. Components name should start with highest-leveled words and end with descriptive modifying words.
2. Components with no content should be self-closing in SFC.
3. Component names in JS/JSXÂ should always be PascalCase.
4. Use **Full word** in components names.
5. Props declaration should be camelCase.
6. El with multi attr should be separated into multi lines.
7. Expression in templates should be simple, with all the computation and judgement contained in the computed properties.
8. Complex computed properties should be split into as many simpler properties as possible.
9. Attr values should be quoted(`""`).
10. Use shorthands(`@` for `v-on` for example) always or never.

[^1]: Those who only contain HTML el, other base components and 3rd-party UI components.
